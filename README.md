# Nucleus
Nucleus is a hybrid operating system kernel designed to run on the x86_64/amd64 architecture. It has been developed in small steps by me since July of this year.

Nucleus is the biggest component of a much bigger project called Atom OS, which is my attempt at making a full, modern, and stable operating system from scratch that I can bundle with my Atom computers - which have already been fully planned out.
